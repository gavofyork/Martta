Milestone 1: Technology Preview.

INSTALLATION

Martta has two dependencies; Qt version 4.6 or above and GccXML's CVS repository.

Qt may be downloaded from Trolltech's site, www.trolltech.com.

GccXML may be downloaded from www.gccxml.org.

Mac OS X
--------

You will need Apple's developer toolset which includes GCC and make as well as Qt-4.6 or above. Open martta.pro with Qt Creator and build/run normally. Martta expects gccxml to be in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.

Windows
-------

You will need an MSVC build of Qt-4.6. Martta was built with MSVC 2008 Express Edition. In a terminal, run:

	qmake -r -tp vc

followed by:

	nmake

Martta expects GccXML to be installed in either C:\Program Files or in the Martta source's root.

Linux
-----

Make sure you have GCC (including g++) and make as well as the full (developer) installation of Qt-4.6 or above. Open martta.pro with Qt Creator and build/run normally. Martta expects gccxml to be in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.
