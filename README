INTRODUCTION

INSTALLATION

NOTE: Currently Martta is non-trivial to build. This will be improved in forthcoming releases.

Martta has two dependencies; Qt version 4.4 or above and GccXML. Regarding the latter, I use
the latest version from the CVS repository, but you might like to try earlier versions if they
are most convenient to install for you.

Qt may be downloaded from Trolltech's site, www.trolltech.com.

GccXML may be downloaded from www.gccxml.org.

Mac OS X
--------

You will need Apple's developer toolset which includes GCC and make. Once installed and
working you can use the qmake utility provided by Qt in this directory to build Martta. The
final application is to be found in the bin/ path, and is called Martta.
